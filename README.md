## Final Report: 

The Final Report pdf is the final submission for this project. (This pdf was generated on google docs, and the corresponding word file is also included for reproducibility.)

## Reproducibility:
To reproduce all the figures, graphs, tables, and results from the final report, run through the R code in the `project2.R` file. (Make sure you have installed the required libraries such as `ggplot`, `dplyr`, `gridExtra`, `GGally`, etc.)

+ note: splitting the data into training and testing takes a while to run. To quicken the process, this data has been saved in `data/*.csv` . In R, simply load the data by `read.csv("data/*.csv")`
